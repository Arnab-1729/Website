        <strong>Dissipative Dynamics of Nuclear Fusion</strong><br>
        Supervisor: Dr. Jhilam Sadhukhan, VECC Kolkata.<br>
        In this project, I calculated the Capture Cross-section of nuclear fusion using a 4-D Langevin Dynamical Model.<br>

        <strong>Effect of the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) on the Galactic UV Radiation Field</strong><br>
        Supervisor: Dr. Kartick C. Sarkar, RRI, Bengaluru.<br>
        During the summer of 2025, I attended the RRI Astronomy Summer School held at the Raman Research Institute,
		Bengaluru, where I carried out a project under the supervision of Dr. Kartick Chandra Sarkar.The purpose of the
		project was to find the local radiation field of a polytropic gas as the CGM in a dark matter halo under hydrostatic
		equilibrium. The project involved numerically solving the angle-dependent radiative transfer equation with depen-
		dence on radial distance and the cosine of the polar angle, resulting in a two-dimensional partial differential equation.
		I implemented a ray-tracing–based numerical method to compute the radiation field in the circumgalactic medium
		(CGM). The emissivities used in the radiative transfer calculations were taken from tabulated outputs generated using
		the CLOUDY code, assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium, and were used as fixed inputs to the radiative transfer
		calculation. This project familiarized me with the basic steps involved in numerical implementation, including con-
		verting a theoretical equation into a discretized computational algorithm, working with tabulated physical inputs, and
		examining the behavior of numerical solutions.
